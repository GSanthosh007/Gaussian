# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.  Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
2. Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
3. Using the np.linalg.eig(), we get two results (first is eigenvalue and second is eigenvector) of the given matrix.
4. End the program

## Program:
```

import numpy as np
import sys

# Reading number of unknowns
n = int(input())

# Making numpy array of n x n+1 size and initializing 
# to zero for storing augmented matrix
a = np.zeros((n,n+1))

# Making numpy array of n size and initializing 
# to zero for storing solution vector
x = np.zeros(n)

# Reading augmented matrix coefficients
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j] = float(input())

# Applying Gauss Elimination
for i in range(n):
    if a[i][i] == 0.0:
        sys.exit('Divde by zero detected!')
        
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        ratio = a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        
        for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k] = a[j][k] - ratio * a[i][k]

# Back Substitution
x[n-1] = a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]

for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    x[i] = a[i][n]
    
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        x[i] = x[i] - a[i][j]*x[j]
    
    x[i] = x[i]/a[i][i]

# Displaying solution
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.2f' %(i,x[i]), end = ' ')
```

## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
